An autonomous risk intelligence agent that scrapes multiple news sources effeciently and applies summarization, entity classification, sentiment analysis and identifies bias and displays the news in a good interactive manner. The **MAIN** functionality of this platform is that users can put in topics of interests in a watchlist. The platform scrapes news in scheduled intervals and if picks up a topic with negative sentiment regarding the topics in the watchlist it creates an **INTELLIGENCE BREIFING** and sends it to the user. If we take an example of PR Departmants of a company or a political party, it takes a group of people hours to go through multiple sites to find negative articles to handle them accordingly, my Platform does that hours of work alone in minutes and is there 24/7 so users get the information as soon as the news is published not wasting essential time. The same can be used in finance departments to see any crashes in the market earlier, by transportation companies to look out for protests, for NGOs regarding any catastrophes, and by individuals who wish to know latest information regarding topics of interest.
